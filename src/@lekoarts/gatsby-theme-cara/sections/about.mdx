## About

Back when i was a kid I was always passionate about how things worked inside a computer. My first encounter was in a school lab where we were trying out DOS and the attraction to it grew even stronger when i played the default games which came with windows xp like pinball, minesweeper and after that it just kept growing bigger. Well the rest of the story is just me going through college and other common things. After graduating
last year I started working as a software developer. Till now I've been working on web development and dev ops mostly. But i'm also instrested in trying out any game development or design projects.
